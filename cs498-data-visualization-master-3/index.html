        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            This telecommunications dataset contains user activities, includes SMS, Internet and Calls,
            (Call Detail Record) generated by an Italian cellular network provider over the city of Milano
            in November 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in finding out how people use phone in different time range and in different areas.

            <strong>Hybrid Structure</strong>
            This narrative visualization follows an interactive slideshow hybrid structure to guide users through
            various selected scenarios.
            This is the best choice for this dataset as it is too big to be presented to users directly.
            Data for each slide has been pre-processed and aggregated separately offline.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            Four scenes have been included in this visualization using consistent template and layout. Each slide
            can be navigated using arrows at left or right, or using the navigation dots on top. Or use keyboard
            left and right buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Interesting trends are annotated using orange color font and box in chart 1, 2 and 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Chart 2 and 3 include filters to display data from selected type of data source. Chart 4 includes a checkbox
            to reveal / hide grid that covers on top of the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Triggers</strong>
            The animation of chart 3 and 4 will be triggered automatically when the scene / slide is displayed. Changing
            filter in chart 3 will also trigger the chart animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <small>Chrome is recommended. Chart 4 may be very slow or unresponsive in other browsers.</small>

            The first scatter chart shows Call activities drops significantly at night especially during week days. However
            it is difficult to see the details in this view as logarithmic scale has been applied on Y Axis.
          </p>

            So let's move on to next scene.

            The second bar chart clearly shows that Internet activities out-weight SMS and Call activities, and Internet
            activities happens all the time throughout the day, even after mid-night.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, SMS and Call activities mostly occur in day time. The two peak periods are between
            8AM – 12PM and 2PM – 6PM. People make much less SMS and Calls at night and sleeping time. The usage of Calls
            dropped quickly after business hours.

            The fourth grid chart will render all activities in City of Milano in a day. The city is divided into
            100000 (100 x 100) squares according to the dataset. It is clear to see majority of activities happens in
            city areas, whereas activities cease in other areas. This is what has been observed in all previous charts.
